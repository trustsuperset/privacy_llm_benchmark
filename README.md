# LLM Performance on Privacy Certification Exams

üèÜ **Research Study** ¬∑ üìä **Data & Visualizations** ¬∑ üìà **Results Analysis**

This repository contains research on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on professional privacy and AI governance certification exams. The study evaluates how well leading LLMs perform on standardized privacy certification exams administered by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).

## Overview

This research evaluates LLM performance across four prestigious privacy certification exams:

- **CIPP/US** - Certified Information Privacy Professional/United States
- **CIPM** - Certified Information Privacy Manager  
- **CIPT** - Certified Information Privacy Technologist
- **AIGP** - Artificial Intelligence Governance Professional

## Key Findings

### Overall Performance

The CIPP/US exam focuses on U.S. privacy law and regulations, covering:
- Domain I: Introduction to the U.S. Privacy Environment
- Domain II: Limits on Private-sector Collection and Use of Data
- Domain III: Government and Court Access to Private-sector Information
- Domain IV: Workplace Privacy
- Domain V: State Privacy Laws

#### CIPM Exam Results

The CIPM exam evaluates privacy program management skills across:
- Domain I: Privacy Program: Developing a Framework
- Domain II: Privacy Program: Establishing Program Governance
- Domain III: Privacy Operational Life Cycle: Assessing Data
- Domain IV: Privacy Operational Life Cycle: Protecting Personal Data
- Domain V: Privacy Operational Life Cycle: Sustaining Program Governance
- Domain VI: Privacy Operational Life Cycle: Responding to Requests and Incidents

#### CIPT Exam Results

The CIPT exam assesses privacy technology expertise in:
- Domain I: Foundational Principles
- Domain II: The Privacy Technologist's Role in the Context of the Organization
- Domain III: Privacy Risks, Threats and Violations
- Domain IV: Privacy-Enhancing Strategies, Techniques and Technologies
- Domain V: Privacy by Design
- Domain VI: Privacy Engineering
- Domain VII: Evolving or Emerging Technologies in Privacy

#### AIGP Exam Results
